# VidCompressor ✂️

A cute, browser-based video compression demo UI.

- 🎨 Pastel, glassmorphism, creator-friendly design  
- 🔐 Frontend-only demo (no real uploads yet)  
- 📦 Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and hosted on GitHub Pages  

## Live Demo

## How it works (demo)

1. Choose a video from your device
2. Pick a quality preset
3. Fake progress bar + status updates simulate compression
4. “Download” shows a demo alert (no real file processing yet)

This UI is ready to be wired to a real FFmpeg / API backend later.
